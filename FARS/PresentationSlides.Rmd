# Motivation
- Fremont County, Wyoming had 27 fatal traffic accidents involving alcohol per 100,000 people 
- Morris County, New Jersey had 0.2 fatal traffic accidents involving alcohol per 100,000 people
- What accounts for the disparity in these traffic fatalities?

# Background 
- Over 30000 people die in motor vehicle accidents every year 
- Alcohol-impaired driving incidents account for about 30% of these deaths
- Cost of alcohol-related crashes generally exceeds the cost of non-alcohol related crashes

# Question 
- What factors contribute to drunk driving at an individual and socioeconomic county-level?

# Data Description
- Primary data comes from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) through the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)
    - Datasets containing information about the vehicle, accident, and people involved
- Supplementary data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau through the American Community Survey (ACS)
    - Provides economic, social, and demographic data at county and state levels
    
    
# Google BigQuery 

- Cloud base serverless analytics data warehouse 
- Platform for performing SQL analysis 
- Designed to process GB/PB scale data 
- Data reading and writing available via Hadoop, Spark and Cloud Dataflow
- Data ingestion abilities available from Google Cloud Storage, Google 
  Cloud Datastore or livestream 
- Facilitates collaboration in an infrastructure-less environment 


# Data Visualization
- Shiny
- Leaflet
- Choroplethr


# Variable Description 

- Attributes characterized by:
    - Driver: Indicator for drunk driving, Sex, Age, Driver history (past suspensions, DWI and speeding convictions), Indicator for death at scene of accident/en route to a medical facility 
    - Vehicle: Vehicle speed prior to crash, Extent of damage
    - Accident: Number of fatalities
    - County-level attributes: Total population, Population by sex, 12-month income to poverty level ratio, Health 
      insurance coverage by sex

# Conclusions 


# Future work 

- Extend the study to state level and factor in additional years 
- Predict whether drunk driving was involved at an accident level 
- Analyze whether time of day and weekday/weekend status affects drunk driving incidence
